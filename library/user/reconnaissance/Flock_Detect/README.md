# Flock You

A WiFi Pineapple Pager payload for passively detecting Flock Safety surveillance devices via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) scanning.

## What It Does

Flock You continuously scans for BLE advertisements from Flock Safety infrastructure — ALPR cameras, Penguin backup batteries, and Pigvision devices. When a device is detected, it logs the MAC address, the signal(s) that matched, a label, and **GPS coordinates**, vibrates the Pager, flashes an LED, and displays a color-coded entry on screen.

The scanner runs continuously until you press the Pager's cancel button. All detections are saved to a timestamped log file in `/root/loot/flock_you/`.

### Wardrive mode + diagnostic log (v9.18+)

BLE range is short (~10–30 m). Driving past a pole camera you're in range for only a few seconds, so v9.18 is tuned for drive-bys:

- **Near-continuous scanning.** The adapter is brought up **once** at startup (not reset every cycle) and there is **no inter-cycle sleep**, raising the scan duty cycle from ~67% to ~90%. Scan windows are a short 8 s so a brief fly-by is more likely to land inside an active scan. If the adapter captures nothing for two cycles it self-resets.
- **All-advert diagnostic log.** Every advert seen — not just Flock matches — is recorded to `flock_alladv_<ts>.csv` as `time,mac,manuf_id,rssi,name`. Drive past a *known* camera and this log shows exactly what it broadcasts (manufacturer ID + signal strength). It's the definitive way to tell a detection gap from a camera that simply emits no usable BLE. Detections also now carry `RSSI` (signal strength → proximity).

> **BLE vs WiFi for cameras.** A Falcon *camera* is primarily a WiFi device; the confirmed BLE emitters are the Penguin battery and Pigvision. For mapping cameras while driving, the WiFi path (`wardrive_activate` → WiGLE, then `loot/flock_hits.sh` OUI matching) is more reliable. Run both.

### Field results and v9.19 fixes

A real drive-by confirmed detection works — a Falcon was caught by its **OUI**, with **zero XUNTONG `0x09C8` seen across 1,477 devices**. On this hardware the OUI list, not the manufacturer ID, is what finds Falcons.

That drive also exposed three defects, fixed in v9.19:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Log flooded with `Set scan parameters failed: I/O error` (786 in one run) | Killing `lescan` leaves LE scanning enabled, so the next cycle can't set scan params | Explicit `LE Set Scan Enable=0` between cycles (fast — keeps the duty cycle) |
| Alert buzzed ~30 min after the sighting | Per-device dedup grepped a growing seen-file — O(n²), **measured 79 s per cycle** at 1,477 devices | Single awk pass (**~0 ms**); Flock hits processed *before* the bulk diagnostic write |
| Detection timestamps stale by minutes | Timestamp computed once per cycle | Timestamp taken at the moment of detection |

**Two platform traps worth knowing** (both cost real debugging time):

- The Pager UI runs a payload from a **copy at `/tmp/payload-<id>.sh`** — so `pkill -f '<name>/payload.sh'` never matches a UI-launched instance, and a payload left running from an earlier session is easy to miss. It will hold the BT adapter and skew any test.
- This payload deliberately has **no EXIT/TERM trap**. Background subshells (`hcidump ... &`) inherit an EXIT trap and would delete the live dedup state every cycle; and a TERM trap makes the payload *survive* being killed (bash resumes the loop after a trapped signal), leaving immortal instances fighting over the adapter. Temp files are per-instance (`$$`) and cleaned at startup instead.

### Detection: three signals (v9.17+)

Earlier versions matched only the BLE **device name**. Most real Flock adverts carry *no name* (they broadcast a MAC + manufacturer data), so name-only detection missed them. v9.17 checks three signals and alerts if **any** fire:

| Signal | What it matches | How | Color |
|--------|-----------------|-----|-------|
| **MANUF** | XUNTONG manufacturer ID `0x09C8` in the BLE advertising data — the strongest Flock tell | `hcidump --raw`, byte signature `FF C8 09` | Magenta |
| **OUI** | MAC prefix in `oui_list.txt` (Lite-On chipset + verified Flock/Falcon/Battery prefixes) | `hcidump --raw` MAC + prefix lookup | Yellow |
| **NAME** | BLE name substring: `FS Ext Battery`, `Penguin`, `Pigvision`, `Flock` | `hcitool lescan` (v9.16 behavior) | Cyan |

Each cycle runs `hcidump --raw` and `hcitool lescan` in parallel, then merges hits by MAC (combining tags when more than one signal fires). Note: OUI matching only works on devices advertising a fixed public MAC — randomized BLE addresses won't match an OUI, but the manufacturer-ID signal still catches them.

### GPS Tagging (v9.16+)

Each detection is tagged with a live GPS fix pulled from `gpsd` (via `gpspipe -w` + `jq`, the same method used by `gps-checker`). One fix is read per scan cycle and applied to every detection in that cycle — position doesn't change meaningfully within a ~12 second scan window.

- With a 2D/3D fix, the detection line ends with `lat,lon` and the CSV row is populated.
- With no fix (no receiver, or no satellite lock yet), the detection is tagged `NO_GPS` and the CSV lat/lon columns are left empty — the scanner keeps running normally.

Two files are written per run in `/root/loot/flock_you/`:

| File | Format |
|------|--------|
| `flock_hcitool_<timestamp>.txt` | Human-readable log: `DECT: HH:MM:SS \| MAC \| SIGNALS \| label \| RSSI:xx \| lat,lon` |
| `flock_gps_<timestamp>.csv` | `time,mac,name_or_label,signals,rssi,lat,lon` — Flock hits, ready for mapping |
| `flock_alladv_<timestamp>.csv` | `time,mac,manuf_id,rssi,name` — **every** advert seen (diagnostic, v9.18+) |

For a GPS-tagged drive, start `wardrive_activate` (or `gps-checker`) first so `gpsd` is configured and has a fix before you run Flock You.

## Installation

Copy the payload directory to your Pager via SCP:

```bash
scp -r flock_you root@172.16.52.1:/root/payloads/user/reconnaissance/
```

The directory should contain:
```
flock_you/
  payload.sh        # The scanner payload
  oui_list.txt      # OUI fingerprint database (used for OUI-signal matching)
  README.md         # This file
```

No additional packages are required. The Pager's built-in `hcitool` and `hcidump` handle BLE scanning.

> **Keep this a flat folder.** The Pager's payload scanner treats any directory
> containing a subdirectory as a *category* rather than a payload, which hides it
> from the on-device list. Do not nest folders inside `Flock_Detect/`. The
> companion ESP32 lab simulator (which runs on separate Arduino hardware, not the
> Pager) lives at `docs/flock-lab-sim/` — outside the deployable `library/` tree —
> for this reason.

## Usage

1. Navigate to **Payloads** on the Pager dashboard
2. Select **Flock You** from the reconnaissance category
3. The scan starts immediately with a color key legend on screen
4. Detections appear in real time with color coding, vibration, and LED flash
5. Press the **cancel button** to stop — the Pager will ask to confirm

## How It Works

Each scan cycle:

1. Resets the BLE adapter (`hci0`) to ensure a clean state
2. Runs `hcitool lescan --duplicates` for ~12 seconds
3. Greps the results for known Flock device name patterns
4. Reads one GPS fix from `gpsd` for the cycle (or `NO_GPS` if unavailable)
5. Deduplicates against an in-memory list of previously seen MAC+Name pairs
6. Logs new detections to screen (with color), to the `.txt` loot file, and to the `.csv`
6. Fires haptic vibration and LED flash on detection
7. Waits 3 seconds, then repeats

## The Story Behind This Project

This payload started as a conversation about building an OUI-based surveillance device detector for the WiFi Pineapple Pager — inspired by the OUISpy concept of fingerprinting devices by their MAC address prefixes.

### The Hard Part: Learning the Pager

The WiFi Pineapple Pager is a new device with limited documentation for payload development. The journey from idea to working code involved solving a chain of platform-specific problems:

**Silent crashes (v1–v3):** Early versions used bash features that the Pager's environment couldn't handle — associative arrays (`declare -A`), Perl-compatible regex (`grep -P`), massive inline string variables, and multi-assignment `local` declarations. The payload would crash instantly with no error output, making debugging blind.

**File path resolution (v4):** The `oui_list.txt` companion file couldn't be found because `$(dirname "$0")` didn't resolve as expected in the Pager's payload execution context. This was eventually solved with fallback path detection, though later testing with other working payloads (Blue Clues) confirmed `dirname "$0"` does work — the earlier failures were caused by the crashes masking the real problem.

**Wrong interface name (v4–v4.1):** WiFi scanning targeted `wlan1`, which doesn't exist. The Pager's PineAP engine pre-creates `wlan1mon` in monitor mode. This was discovered by SSH-ing into the device and running `iw dev`.

**Exit loop confusion (OUI-SPY variants):** Multiple attempts at building a stop mechanism — signal traps, stop files, button press racing, confirmation dialogs between cycles — were all unnecessary. The Pager UI has a built-in cancel button that prompts "Stop payload?" and kills the process. The earlier payloads couldn't be stopped because they were crashing, not because they lacked an exit mechanism.

**The breakthrough:** A working reference payload (Blue Clues by Brandon Starkweather) showed the correct patterns — `PROMPT` for info screens, `NUMBER_PICKER` for config, direct sysfs GPIO/LED control, `hcitool inq` for classic Bluetooth, and timed or continuous loops with `exit 0`. Applying these patterns to the Flock detection logic produced the working v9.15.

### What We Learned About Pager Payloads

For anyone else writing Pager payloads, these lessons were hard-won:

- Payloads are bash scripts with DuckyScript commands (`LOG`, `PROMPT`, `NUMBER_PICKER`, etc.) available as executables in PATH
- `LOG color "message"` works — colors include yellow, green, magenta, cyan
- `while true` is the correct pattern for continuous scans — the Pager cancel button handles termination
- Direct hardware access works: `/sys/class/gpio/vibrator/value` for haptics, `/sys/class/leds/` for LEDs
- The Pager has a built-in OUI database at `/lib/hak5/oui.txt`
- BLE interface is `hci0`, WiFi monitor interface is `wlan1mon` (not `wlan1`)
- Always end with `exit 0` or the Pager reports an error
- Keep it simple — complex bash features and subshell tricks are unreliable

## OUI List

The included `oui_list.txt` contains 69 MAC prefix entries for WiFi-based detection (for future expansion beyond BLE):

- **5 Flock Verified** — Camera OUIs confirmed from WiGLE wardriving data
- **5 Flock Battery** — Penguin battery OUIs from WiGLE BLE data
- **55 Lite-On Technology** — Flock Falcon V2 uses the WCBN3510A WiFi chipset
- **3 Sierra Wireless** — Flock LTE modem
- **2 Lantronix** — Flock system-on-module

These were compiled from real-world field data in the colonelpanichacks/flock-you datasets and cross-referenced with FCC filings and hardware teardown research.
