# Flock You

A WiFi Pineapple Pager payload for passively detecting Flock Safety surveillance devices via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) scanning.

## What It Does

Flock You continuously scans for BLE advertisements from Flock Safety infrastructure — ALPR cameras, Penguin backup batteries, and Pigvision devices. When a device is detected, it logs the MAC address, device name, and **GPS coordinates**, vibrates the Pager, flashes an LED, and displays a color-coded entry on screen.

The scanner runs continuously until you press the Pager's cancel button. All detections are saved to a timestamped log file in `/root/loot/flock_you/`.

### GPS Tagging (v9.16+)

Each detection is tagged with a live GPS fix pulled from `gpsd` (via `gpspipe -w` + `jq`, the same method used by `gps-checker`). One fix is read per scan cycle and applied to every detection in that cycle — position doesn't change meaningfully within a ~12 second scan window.

- With a 2D/3D fix, the detection line ends with `lat,lon` and the CSV row is populated.
- With no fix (no receiver, or no satellite lock yet), the detection is tagged `NO_GPS` and the CSV lat/lon columns are left empty — the scanner keeps running normally.

Two files are written per run in `/root/loot/flock_you/`:

| File | Format |
|------|--------|
| `flock_hcitool_<timestamp>.txt` | Human-readable log: `DECT: HH:MM:SS \| MAC \| NAME \| lat,lon` |
| `flock_gps_<timestamp>.csv` | `time,mac,name,lat,lon` — ready for mapping / import |

For a GPS-tagged drive, start `wardrive_activate` (or `gps-checker`) first so `gpsd` is configured and has a fix before you run Flock You.

### Detection Targets

| Device | BLE Name Pattern | Log Color |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Flock FS Ext Battery | `FS Ext Battery` | Yellow |
| Flock Penguin | `Penguin-*` | Green |
| Pigvision | `Pigvision` | Magenta |
| Other Flock devices | `*flock*` | Cyan |

## Installation

Copy the payload directory to your Pager via SCP:

```bash
scp -r flock_you root@172.16.52.1:/root/payloads/user/reconnaissance/
```

The directory should contain:
```
flock_you/
  payload.sh        # The scanner payload
  oui_list.txt      # OUI fingerprint database (for future WiFi expansion)
  README.md         # This file
```

No additional packages are required. The Pager's built-in `hcitool` handles BLE scanning.

> **Keep this a flat folder.** The Pager's payload scanner treats any directory
> containing a subdirectory as a *category* rather than a payload, which hides it
> from the on-device list. Do not nest folders inside `Flock_Detect/`. The
> companion ESP32 lab simulator (which runs on separate Arduino hardware, not the
> Pager) lives at `docs/flock-lab-sim/` — outside the deployable `library/` tree —
> for this reason.

## Usage

1. Navigate to **Payloads** on the Pager dashboard
2. Select **Flock You** from the reconnaissance category
3. The scan starts immediately with a color key legend on screen
4. Detections appear in real time with color coding, vibration, and LED flash
5. Press the **cancel button** to stop — the Pager will ask to confirm

## How It Works

Each scan cycle:

1. Resets the BLE adapter (`hci0`) to ensure a clean state
2. Runs `hcitool lescan --duplicates` for ~12 seconds
3. Greps the results for known Flock device name patterns
4. Reads one GPS fix from `gpsd` for the cycle (or `NO_GPS` if unavailable)
5. Deduplicates against an in-memory list of previously seen MAC+Name pairs
6. Logs new detections to screen (with color), to the `.txt` loot file, and to the `.csv`
6. Fires haptic vibration and LED flash on detection
7. Waits 3 seconds, then repeats

## The Story Behind This Project

This payload started as a conversation about building an OUI-based surveillance device detector for the WiFi Pineapple Pager — inspired by the OUISpy concept of fingerprinting devices by their MAC address prefixes.

### The Hard Part: Learning the Pager

The WiFi Pineapple Pager is a new device with limited documentation for payload development. The journey from idea to working code involved solving a chain of platform-specific problems:

**Silent crashes (v1–v3):** Early versions used bash features that the Pager's environment couldn't handle — associative arrays (`declare -A`), Perl-compatible regex (`grep -P`), massive inline string variables, and multi-assignment `local` declarations. The payload would crash instantly with no error output, making debugging blind.

**File path resolution (v4):** The `oui_list.txt` companion file couldn't be found because `$(dirname "$0")` didn't resolve as expected in the Pager's payload execution context. This was eventually solved with fallback path detection, though later testing with other working payloads (Blue Clues) confirmed `dirname "$0"` does work — the earlier failures were caused by the crashes masking the real problem.

**Wrong interface name (v4–v4.1):** WiFi scanning targeted `wlan1`, which doesn't exist. The Pager's PineAP engine pre-creates `wlan1mon` in monitor mode. This was discovered by SSH-ing into the device and running `iw dev`.

**Exit loop confusion (OUI-SPY variants):** Multiple attempts at building a stop mechanism — signal traps, stop files, button press racing, confirmation dialogs between cycles — were all unnecessary. The Pager UI has a built-in cancel button that prompts "Stop payload?" and kills the process. The earlier payloads couldn't be stopped because they were crashing, not because they lacked an exit mechanism.

**The breakthrough:** A working reference payload (Blue Clues by Brandon Starkweather) showed the correct patterns — `PROMPT` for info screens, `NUMBER_PICKER` for config, direct sysfs GPIO/LED control, `hcitool inq` for classic Bluetooth, and timed or continuous loops with `exit 0`. Applying these patterns to the Flock detection logic produced the working v9.15.

### What We Learned About Pager Payloads

For anyone else writing Pager payloads, these lessons were hard-won:

- Payloads are bash scripts with DuckyScript commands (`LOG`, `PROMPT`, `NUMBER_PICKER`, etc.) available as executables in PATH
- `LOG color "message"` works — colors include yellow, green, magenta, cyan
- `while true` is the correct pattern for continuous scans — the Pager cancel button handles termination
- Direct hardware access works: `/sys/class/gpio/vibrator/value` for haptics, `/sys/class/leds/` for LEDs
- The Pager has a built-in OUI database at `/lib/hak5/oui.txt`
- BLE interface is `hci0`, WiFi monitor interface is `wlan1mon` (not `wlan1`)
- Always end with `exit 0` or the Pager reports an error
- Keep it simple — complex bash features and subshell tricks are unreliable

## OUI List

The included `oui_list.txt` contains 69 MAC prefix entries for WiFi-based detection (for future expansion beyond BLE):

- **5 Flock Verified** — Camera OUIs confirmed from WiGLE wardriving data
- **5 Flock Battery** — Penguin battery OUIs from WiGLE BLE data
- **55 Lite-On Technology** — Flock Falcon V2 uses the WCBN3510A WiFi chipset
- **3 Sierra Wireless** — Flock LTE modem
- **2 Lantronix** — Flock system-on-module

These were compiled from real-world field data in the colonelpanichacks/flock-you datasets and cross-referenced with FCC filings and hardware teardown research.
